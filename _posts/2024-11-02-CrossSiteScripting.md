#### **Cross Site Scripting**

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability commonly found in web applications. It allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. When an unsuspecting user loads a compromised web page, the injected script is executed in their browser, often without their knowledge. This can lead to various malicious actions, such as:

1. **Cookie Theft**: Attackers can capture session cookies to hijack user accounts.
2. **Phishing**: Users can be tricked into entering sensitive information into fake forms.
3. **Defacement**: Attackers can alter the appearance of a website for malicious purposes.
4. **Malware Distribution**: Malicious scripts can install malware on a user’s device.

### Types of XSS

1. **Stored XSS**: The malicious script is stored on the server (e.g., in a database) and served to users when they request a page.
   
2. **Reflected XSS**: The malicious script is reflected off a web server, often via URL parameters. Users must click on a link containing the malicious script to trigger the attack.

3. **DOM-based XSS**: The vulnerability exists in the client-side code rather than server-side. Manipulation happens within the user’s browser through the Document Object Model (DOM).

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Input Validation**: Ensure that all user inputs are properly validated and sanitized.
  
2. **Output Encoding**: Encode data before rendering it in web pages to prevent it from being executed as code.

3. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.

4. **HttpOnly Cookies**: Set session cookies with the HttpOnly attribute to prevent JavaScript access.

5. **Framework Security Features**: Use security features provided by web frameworks and libraries that automatically handle XSS protection.

### Conclusion

Preventing XSS requires a multi-faceted approach that combines secure coding practices, regular security audits, and user education. By understanding how XSS attacks work, developers can better protect their applications and users.
